            <h3 class="title">Test Design and Development</h3>
            <p>• Develop Test Cases: Create detailed test cases that cover different functionalities, user interactions, and potential edge cases.</p>
            <p>• Identify Test Data: Prepare test data to be used during testing, including valid, invalid, and boundary value data.</p>
            <p>• Choose Testing Tools (Optional): Select automation tools or other specialized software to streamline the testing process if needed.</p>
