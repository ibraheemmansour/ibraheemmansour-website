        "description": "In this paper, learning with a teacher artificial neural network to predict the results of football matches is presented. This type of network requires training via examples. When the training is complete, the network can be tested to check the results of new examples. In this application, the training examples are the results of previous matches, which the network will use to predict the results of new ones.",

        "description": "Despite rational speed limits, many drivers surpass them, endangering public safety. To address this, the 'Speed, Warning, and Public Safety via GPS' system automatically fines speeding drivers by transmitting their information to the police and alerting them when they approach speed limits. This university project, limited to specific areas, uses a GPS receiver, microcontroller, and Ethernet Shield to detect and report violations, with future plans to expand coverage across Lebanon.",
