            I’m Ibraheem Mansour, an experienced software engineer with over eight years in the field. I’ve long been immersed in the precision of algorithms and coding languages. However, amid the structured logic of my career, I nurtured a desire to express myself beyond the bounds of rationality. It was in storytelling that I found sanctuary. Through the art of writing, I discovered a freedom from binary constraints, allowing my imagination to soar and my emotions to speak.
